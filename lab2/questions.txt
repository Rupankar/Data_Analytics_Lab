Assignment -2

1. Perform the following pre-processing tasks.
(a) Get the dataset and read it using read.csv function. Dataset contains four columns:
Country, Age, Salary, Purchased and has total 10 observations. Dataset contains
information of customers of some company and first three columns are information
of a customer like country, age, salary and fourth column tells if the customer has
purchased the product of the company or not. The attribute ”Purchase” is the target
variable.

(b) The dataset contains missing data. Handle the missing data by taking mean/median/mode,

(c) Encode categorical data. Encode ”France”, ”Spain” and ”Germany” with 1, 2, 3
values. Also encode the target variable with 0 and 1 i.e. Encode Yes with 0 and No
with 1. factor function or if-else statement can be used to convert the categorical
features into numeric features.

(d) Scale the dataset using any of the scaling technique. Use scale function to scale the
values.


2. Perform the following aggregation tasks.

(a) Get the dataset from UCI ML Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris.

(b) Find the mean of all the metrics (Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width)

(c) Compute the sum of all the metrics across species and group by species.

(d) Compute the count of all the metrics across species and group by species.

(e) Compute the maximum of all the metrics across species and group by species.


Note: The aggregate function has the following syntax aggregate(x, by, FUN, . . . ,
simplify = TRUE, drop = TRUE)
X is an R object, Mostly a dataframe
by :- a list of grouping elements, by which the subsets are grouped by
FUN :- a function to compute the summary statistics
simplify:- a logical indicating whether results should be simplified to a vector or
matrix if possible
drop:- a logical indicating whether to drop unused combinations of grouping values.
